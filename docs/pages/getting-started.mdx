# Get Started

EVM Kit takes a few minutes to get up and running.

<Callout emoji="👨🏼‍💻" type="info">
  **Pre-requisites**: You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/),
  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm),
  [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install),
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and a browser wallet (e.g.
  [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)).
</Callout>

Run the following command to clone the repository to your machine:

```bash copy
npx evmkit@latest create my-evmkit-app
```

Change directories into the project:

```bash copy
cd my-evmkit-app
```

Open the project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
The repository comes with a set of [recommended extensions](/.vscode/extensions.json)
for building web3 apps; when you open the project, VS Code will prompt you to install them.

## Terminal Setup

The recommended way to use this project is to open **three** terminals simultaneously:

1. Runs the local node to deploy your smart contracts to
2. Is free to use for things like deploying smart contracts, running tests, git, yarn, etc.
3. Runs the frontend application

### Terminal One: Local Node

Terminal one essentially mimics the behavior of an EVM blockchain on your
local machine using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

> Hardhat comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network node designed for development.
> It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code,
> all within the confines of your local machine.

To set this, up run the following commands:

```bash
cd contracts      # Change directories into the contracts folder
yarn              # Install dependencies (only required the first time you set up the project)
yarn run-node     # Start the local node
```

This will print the following output:

```bash
Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/

Accounts
========

WARNING: These accounts, and their private keys, are publicly known.
Any funds sent to them on Mainnet or any other live network WILL BE LOST.

Account 0: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 (10000 ETH)
Private Key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

These wallets are publicly known and contain test funds for you to interact with your smart contracts
from your browser wallet.

<Callout type="error">
  Never send real funds to these accounts! They are **not** unique to you.
</Callout>

Leave this terminal running in the background.

### Terminal Two: Miscellaneous

The second terminal is free to use for things like deploying smart contracts, running tests, git, yarn, etc.

To set up the project, we&rsquo;ll use it to deploy the smart contracts to the local node.

Run the following commands:

```bash
cd contracts          # Change directories into the contracts folder
yarn deploy-local     # Deploy the smart contracts to the local node
```

This command uses a [Hardhat script](https://hardhat.org/guides/scripts.html)
to deploy the smart contracts to the local node, and update the frontend application
with the addresses and ABIs of the deployed contracts automatically.

Each time you make a change to your smart contracts,
you can run this command to redeploy them to the local node and
update the frontend application.

Some other useful commands you can run in this terminal:

```bash
yarn build           # Compile the smart contracts and detect what features are implemented
yarn test            # Run the smart contract test suite
```

### Terminal Three: Frontend

Terminal three runs the frontend of your application using [Next.js's CLI](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli).

Run the following commands:

```bash
cd application          # Change directories into the application folder
yarn                    # Install dependencies (only required the first time you set up the project)
yarn dev                # Start the frontend application
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application running.

> `next dev` starts the application in development mode with hot-code reloading, error reporting, and more:
> The application will start at http://localhost:3000 by default. The default port can be changed with -p

Leave this terminal running in the background.

## Add a burner private key

<Callout type="info">
  This step is only required if you want to use Sign in with Ethereum.
</Callout>

To authenticate users using Sign in with Ethereum, you need a private key in your environment.

**Use a burner wallet. NOT your main wallet. The account does not need any funds.**

1. Create a file called `.env.local` at the root of the `application` folder.
2. Populate it as follows _(replace `xyz` with your PK)_: `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=xyz`

## Next Steps

That&rsquo;s it! You&rsquo;re ready to start working with EVM Kit.

Next, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the different pieces of the project.
