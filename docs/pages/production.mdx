# Going to Production

The project is intended to be iterated on using the local chain, although this is
not a requirement.

When you are ready to [GTFOL](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GTFOL),
you can deploy both your smart contract and front end to the public.

1. Deploy your smart contract(s).
2. Add your contract addresses and network to the `contractAddresses.ts` file.
3. Deploy your application to Vercel.

### Deploying Smart Contracts

From the `contracts` directory, run `yarn deploy` to compile and deploy your smart contracts to any EVM test network or mainnet with the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboards) flow; no private keys required!

Once deployed, copy each of your smart contract addresses from the dashboard.

### Update Contract Addresses

Inside the `contractAddresses.ts` file, there is a placeholder for you to put the deployed contract address for each contract you have created.

```diff
export const internalContractAddresses = {
    [DEV_CHAIN_ID]: {
      greeter: {
        "address": "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3",
        "abi": [{...}]
      }
    },
    [PRODUCTION_CHAIN_ID]: {
      greeter: {
-       "address": "<INSERT PRODUCTION ADDRESS HERE>",
+       "address": "your-smart-contract-address-here",
        "abi": [{...}]
      }
    },
  };

```

### Setting Production Network

In the same `contractAddresses.ts` file, ensure you set the production network you want to use.

You can also modify the network you want to use for development here if you don&rsquo;t want to use a local node.

_For example, if you want to deploy to Ethereum mainnet, change the following lines:_

```diff
- export const PRODUCTION_CHAIN_ID = ChainId.Polygon
+ export const PRODUCTION_CHAIN_ID = ChainId.Mainnet
- export const PRODUCTION_CHAIN_ID_ENUM_NAME = "Polygon";
+ export const PRODUCTION_CHAIN_ID_ENUM_NAME = "Mainnet";
```

### Deploying Application

Use the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) to deploy your application to Vercel.

```bash
cd application
```

Install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

Deploy your application:

```bash
vercel
```

The logic inside the `contractAddresses.ts` file automatically
uses your production network and contract addresses on your deployed application,
while using your development network and contract addresses
on your local development environment.
