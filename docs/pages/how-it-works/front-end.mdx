# Frontend

The frontend can be found in the `application` folder.
It is a Next.js application written in TypeScript.

To connect to user&rsquo;s wallets, interact with smart contracts, and more,
it uses the [thirdweb React SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdk).

To run the frontend, run the `yarn dev` command in the `application` folder.

## thirdweb React SDK

The thirdweb React SDK uses a
[provider pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/provider-pattern/) to expose React hooks
built on top of [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and
[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).
EVM Kit uses these hooks for wallet connection, smart contract interaction, and general
blockchain interactions.

The thirdweb SDK also provides a free, production-ready RPC to read from and write data to
the blockchain, as well as a free IPFS gateway and pinning service for storing
and retrieving data from IPFS.

## Optional Extensions

You might need additional functionality for your application depending on your use case.

Below are some optional extensions that integrate nicely with EVM Kit.

### wagmi & RainbowKit

[wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) is an excellent library with additional React hooks to interact with EVM.

Using wagmi, it&rsquo;s recommended you also integrate with [Rainbow Kit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/),
which provides UI components for connecting to user&rsquo;s wallets.

### Custom RPCs

thirdweb provides a free, production-ready RPC out of the box, but you can also provide your own
and override the default RPC. Some services are available for you to do this, including:

- [Infura](https://infura.io/)
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)

### Indexing Tools

If you need data that isn&rsquo;t directly available from your smart contracts,
_(such as what NFTs a wallet owns)_, you can
use a variety of tools that provide APIs for this data. Such as:

- [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)
- [Alchemy SDK](https://www.alchemy.com/sdk)
