# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are the foundation for any web3 application.

The `contracts` directory contains an environment for you to write, test, and deploy your smart contracts.

Included in the environment are the following tools:

- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/) for writing smart contracts.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for compiling and testing smart contracts.
- [thirdweb ContractKit](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) for smart contracts on popular ERC standards.
- [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/) for more helpful utility smart contracts.

## Writing Smart Contracts

EVM Kit uses [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/) for writing smart contracts.
[thirdweb ContractKit](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) and
[OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/)
are tools that help you write secure, gas-optimized smart contracts, and easily incorporate
them into your own contracts using [inheritance](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/contracts.html#inheritance).

The repository comes with an example `Greeter.sol`
contract that you can use as a starting point for your own contracts;
containing a `view`, `function`, and `event` to help you get started.

## Testing Smart Contracts

A TypeScript test environment is included in the `test` directory,
which you can run using `yarn test`.

Running `yarn build` will compile your smart contracts
and log which [extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit/extensions) you have
implemented.

## Deploying Smart Contracts

There are two ways to deploy smart contracts provided by EVM Kit:

1. Local node (using Hardhat).
2. EVM-compatible Testnets & mainnets (using thirdweb).

### Local Node

As mentioned in the [getting started](/getting-started), Hardhat provides a way for you to
run your own local node for testing and development purposes. This is the recommended way
to test out how your smart contracts work from your frontend.

You can do this by running `yarn deploy-local` in the `contracts` directory.

EVM Kit runs a script to automatically update your application code with the latest
deployed contract addresses and ABIs, so you can start using them right away without
changing any configuration yourself.

### Testnets & Mainnets

Using [thirdweb deploy](https://portal.thirdweb.com/deploy),
your smart contracts can be deployed to any EVM-compatible testnets and mainnets
using the `yarn deploy` command from within the `contracts` directory. This is generally for when you're ready to deploy your application to production.
