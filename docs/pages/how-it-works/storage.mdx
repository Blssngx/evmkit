# Decentralized Storage

EVM Kit uses [thirdweb Storage](https://portal.thirdweb.com/storage)'s React hooks that allow uploading and downloading information to and from IPFS.

The thirdweb React SDK provides a free IPFS gateway and automatic pinning of uploads
to IPFS, as well as [UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to
easily render them in your app.
