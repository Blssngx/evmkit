# Why EVM Kit?

Tooling for both web3 and the broader web is evolving constantly.
Since 2021, the tools available for building web3 have improved dramatically.

_The thing is_, most of us are relatively new to this whole web3 thing.
For this reason, _most_ of the onboarding material you&rsquo;ll find is intentionally beginner-oriented.
This is great for getting started,
but when you want to go deeper, you might find yourself down many different rabbit holes.

EVM Kit is an opinionated suite of tools for building production-ready web3 applications designed to address this.
It encourages you to use the best tools available, with intentional DX optimizations, community support available,
and thorough documentation; it aims to be both **production-ready** and **beginner-friendly**.
