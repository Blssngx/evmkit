Vercel with Git is the easiest way to deploy apps built with EVM Kit.

There's not much more to say here, you can follow
[Vercel's guide to Deploying with Git repos](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/git#deploying-a-git-repository).

Ensure you set any environment variables that you are using in the `.env` file in the **Environment Variables** section of the Vercel dashboard.
